Party Boi: Hi Mr. Moody, looks like you're having a rough day.
Party Boi: When I'm feeling like that I find deep breathing helps.
Party Boi: I imagine a leaf rising as I breath out and falling as I breath in.
Party Boi: I heard a great way to start and stop is by thinking of "B".

=> END!

Party Boi: Hi Mr. Moody, looks like you gave deep breathing a go.
Party Boi: I can see you're looking a little better :).
Party Boi: If you want to do some more remember the "B".

=> END!
